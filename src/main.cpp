  Description    : Displays random peculiar facts
  Purpose        : To exercise collaborative source code development
  Usage          : nuttyfact
  Build with     : g++ -Wall -g -o oddities  main.cpp
  Modifications  : Added output_function  LiudmilaZyrianova239_oddity;
  Notes:
  The number N below is the number of people on each team.
  This program prints N peculiar facts, called "oddities" here.
  The main program calls N functions, each with the syntax defined
  by the output_function typedef defined below. Each function must be 
  named 
       username_oddity

  where username is the GitHub username of its author.
  For example, 
      output_function  stewartweiss_oddity;

  Oddities are found in the file "oddities.txt" in the project source directory
